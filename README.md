As the name suggests

Overview:

  I think, a place where your create branches,repositories individually that are sorted and stored in a file as txt. Similarly to Github Desktop, RelaGit and stuff out there.

  The difference is 
  -
  you do not need to sign in, 
  customize your txt style ,
  ,auto save(?),
  search the entire folder as control +f, 

  When you access to the file, you can rearrange txt, and custom templates of custom design alignments.
    
  Of course, design takes ages to master. For that, copying something related to my idea could be the solution.
  RelaGit is one of the few options.

  I am still looking for more insperation. DONE
  - Analysing on what to use.
